# PlayIdleHelper

PlayIdleHelper is a userscript intended to provide quality of life improvements to [PlayIdle.com](https://www.playidle.com/)
Since the game seems dead and isn't holding my interest well, I'm not going to make this an actual extension.
Which means it won't automatically update etc.

## Current Features

- Calculates total property income
- Calculates ROI for properties
- Filter jobs (currently hides all jobs except surgeon)
- Automatically spend energy (down to 10)

## Installation

This installs as an unpacked browser extension, the below example is for chrome
Might not work on non-chromium based browsers, haven't tested and probably won't

1. Download this repo
2. Unzip it anywhere
3. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
4. Click "load unpacked extension"
5. Select the directory of the extension
6. Done!
